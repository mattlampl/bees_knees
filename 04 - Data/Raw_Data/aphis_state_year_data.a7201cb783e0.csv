The popup on hover provides the,,,,,,,,,"Molecular targets with a negative result are represented with a '-' in their cell, while positve results are represented with a '+'. Some data has quantitaive results that have been ranked into percentiles. The percentile shows the percent of samples found at the same level, or below, for that particular target. You can think of it as a ranking from 0 to 100, with lower rank is ""better"" (less virus). For example, a pathogen found to be postive and ranked at 'below 30th', would be a relatively low level at the lower third compared to other samples. Sampling targets are described below.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
