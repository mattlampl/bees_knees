Source,Link,Description,How Found,Note
APHIS Dataset,https://ushoneybeehealthsurvey.info/,"Sourced from the National Honey Bee Survey, this dataset contains feature data on factors that can impact honeybee populations, including levels of varroa mites, Nosema spores, and more.",Sara found this dataset in an online search for honeybee data,You must create a user account to gain access to this free dataset. 
Honey Neonic Dataset,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kevinzmith/honey-with-neonic-pesticide,"Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset includes our target variables (number of honeybee colonies and honey production levels) as well as feature variables, such as levels of exposure to various toxins that harm honeybee populations.",Sara found this dataset when the team was identifying potential project directions.,
State Climate Extremes,https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/scec/records,"Sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this dataset contains historical temperature at the state level",Sara found this dataset in search of temperature data to create feature variables,
Urbanicity Dataset,https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.icip.iastate.edu%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fuploads%2Ftables%2Fpopulation%2Fpop-urban-pct-historical.xls&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK,"Sourced from the US Census Bureau, this dataset contains information on the level of urbanicity per state across decennial census years to enable us to see whether states with higher levels of urbanization have impaired honey production levels.",Sara found this dataset online because urbanicity may be an important feature in modeling honeybee populations.,
Air Quality Dataset,https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual,"Sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency, this series of datasets contains county-level information on air quality, such as the number of days in a year with good air quality, hazardous air quality, and levels of PM 2.5 and PM10.",Sara found this dataset online because air quality could impact honeybee viability. ,We downloaded individual CSVs for each year in 1998-2022 and merged them.
Statewide Time Series Datasets,https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/statewide/time-series/1/tavg/ytd/12/1895-2022,"Sourced from NOAA, these datasets contain temperature data for states from 1895-2022.",Irfan found this dataset in an online search for temperature-related feature variables,You must download multiple CSVs to get all states' data.
